Hi! My name is Bryan.

I'm currently a second year SoC (School of Computing) student in NUS majoring in Computer Science.

This portfolio page aims to document the contributions I have made in the development of TutorAid, which is a project that my team and I completed for the module CS2103T. This project has definitely been greatly beneficial to my own learning and self-development in becoming a more competent software engineer.

== PROJECT: TutorAid

== Overview

TutorAid is a handy application that was created with the end goal of helping tutors and teaching assistants in NUS School of Computing. It is a Command Line Interface (CLI) based tool to cater to computing professionals who are highly adept at typing but also provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) interface for users to easily view interact with TutorAid.

TutorAid boasts well thought out features which have been carefully selected and reviewed to fit the exact needs of our target audience. All of TutorAid's features and implementations are well documented in guides for users and developers respectively.

== Role

My main role was to prototype and develop the learning of wrong commands into custom commands feature (or simply the custom shortcut feature) and the Student Profile feature.
The custom shortcut feature required handling command words that are not recognized by TutorAid instead of throwing an exception for invalid commands. I created the base classes to facilitate this whole event flow, then linked it to the Model and Storage components since the custom commands have to be saved for future use. I also wrote rigorous tests for quality assurance of our product and to ensure that any possible bugs are kept to a minimal.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the learning of wrong commands into custom commands*
** What it does: It gives the user the ability to learn commands which they have typed wrongly into TutorAid as a basic command. These custom commands will be saved and pop up as suggestions in the future.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because TutorAid has many different features with 37 commands currently and is still growing. It is extremely difficult for the user to remember all these command words without constantly referring to the user guide and will end up keying in command words wrongly based on their own typing habits. Learning these typing habits will help to improve their efficiency in using TutorAid.
** Implementation: This enhancement alters the flow of command execution in TutorAid. Executing an unknown command that TutorAid does not recognize changes the command execution pathway and sets TutorAid into "learner mode". This is faciliated by the use of a HashMap in the parser which stores a list of all available commands and their actions as key-value pairs(basic commands and previous custom commands loaded from .json file). TutorAid will check against this HashMap to see if the command word exists. If it does not, this command word is saved onto a Stack in the Model component to be retrieved in the next command. If the next command is still unknown, the next command is also added to the Stack. When a valid command that exists in entered, the last unknown command is retrieved from the top on the Stack and is mapped to the action of the aforementioned valid command. This key-value pair is then added to the HashMap and saved into our .json file. TutorAid is then set back into normal mode. The HashMap is also used to generate command suggestions based on the user's input.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added *the Student Profile feature*
** What it does: Allows the user to add students and track all their vital statistics. Pictures can be assigned to individual profiles as well.
** Justification: Since TutorAid is meant to help tutors, having a birds eye view of all their students in all the modules they teach is extremely essential so that they can carry out their job efficiently.
** Implementation: The person class in AB3 was remodelled to resemble a student (with Results, Attendance, Participation etc). Additional commands were also implemented such as mass attendance and participation marking and filtering by class.
