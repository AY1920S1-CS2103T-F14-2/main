****
Hello! My name is Kerwin Lim. I'm a Computer Science Major at the National University of Singapore (NUS). I'm currently in my second year of studies.

This portfolio page aims to document the contributions I have made in the development of TutorAid. TutorAid is a project that my team and I completed for our CS2103T module. We have put in our heart and soul creating TutorAid. It has been a tremendous learning journey for my team and I and we hope that users will enjoy and benefit from our product!

== PROJECT: TutorAid

== Overview

TutorAid is a useful application created for Tutors, by Tutors. The purpose of our application is to be a all encompassing solution to store information such as notes and reminders. Our product is made for tutors and teaching assistants in NUS. However, we have plans to expand to tutors in general. +
By storing their information in one cent ral location, tutors' workspace can be made more simple and organized. This can help improve productivity and enable a smooth workflow. A clear space is indeed a clear mind. +
TutorAid is a Command Line Interface (CLI) based tool that caters to professionals adept at typing. We have recently added more Graphical User Interface (GUI) features to make TutorAid more user friendly and to increase efficiency.

TutorAid boasts well thought out features which have been carefully selected and reviewed to fit the exact needs of our target audience. All of TutorAid's features and implementations are well documented in guides for users and developers respectively.

== Role

My main role was to prototype and develop the Reminders feature, the Calendar feature and make enhancements to the Graphical User Interface.
The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.


== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *Reminders Feature*
** What it does: allows ysers to add Reminders. These will then be displayed in a reminders window that will pop up and remind users of urgent tasks.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because users can be reminded of urgent and important tasks at hand. This will ensure that users have ample time to plan and complete their tasks punctually.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Major enhancement*: added *Calendar Graphical User Interface*
** What it does: allows users to view their Tasks chronologically. These will then be displayed in a reminders window that will pop up and remind users of urgent tasks.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
