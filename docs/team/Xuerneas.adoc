Hi, I'm Xu Tunan, a Year Two SoC Student from National University of Singapore (NUS). This Project Portfolio is aimed to introduce our project -- TutorAid, as well as state my own contributions in this project.

== Overview of the TutorAid

TutorAid is a desktop application that designed to help the teaching assistants in NUS. It is a combination of the Calendar, the Earning Tracker, the Notepad, as well as the Student Profile Manager. +
Those features of TutorAid was selected specifically for the target user - tutors, based on their exact needs. +

The user interacts with TutorAid using a Command Line Interface (CLI), with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX for user to better view the interactions.

== Summary of contributions

* *_Major enhancement_*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: The implementation of the undo and redo commands were inspired by Address Book 4, however more challenging in this project due to the complexity. +

* *_Major enhancement_*: added *the task management commands (Part of Calendar Feature)*
** What it does: allows the user to `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `find`, `list` tasks.
** Justification: This feature is one of the most important features in the TutorAid since it aimed to help tutors and this feature is really useful for tutors. +

* *_Minor enhancement_*: added a sorting method in TaskTime so that in each task, their task times would be sorted automatically.
** Justification: This enhancement is added to show each task clearer. Also, users do not need to worry that they key in the task time in wrong order anymore.
